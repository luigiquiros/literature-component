# literature-component
Modified version of the Literature component from inventa

This repository is a python application for searching the number or reported compounds to species, genus and family levels. 

You only need a clean list of scientific names for your samples. 

To clean up your species go directly to Open Tree of Life! 

The Literature component calculation could be computed or not according to your needs. 
	If yes: the closer the value to 1, the less compounds are reported at each level.
